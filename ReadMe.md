# Test Repository

This is where I would write a Readme about my project, or include documentation.

You can store all your data, R projects, output, and code in this folder. If my data files were too big to host on Github, I might post the link to download them here, with instructions.

Get my data

-   download the 311 data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Local-Law-79-2022-Temporary-Housing-Assistance-Usa/jiwc-ncpi)

-   save it with the name 311.csv

-   read it into R on line 12
